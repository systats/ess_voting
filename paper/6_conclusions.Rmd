Our empirical findings are mainly alongside with our hypotheses. Therefore we can confirm that low levels of political trust leads to a higher likelihood to vote for a right-wing party. We were able to show that distrust in European institutions partly loads on a unique dimension which was reason enough to separately include the term in the final regression model. While the extracted principal component of the trust items turn out to be unstable, the eurosceptic term always remains negatively. Another major explanatory are anti-immigration attitudes. By the means of PCA, we extracted the first two dimensions loading on a cultural as well as economic dimension. The parameters suggest that economic deprivation as well as fear of cultural backslash both contribute independently to an increased likelihood to vote for a right-wing party. People with higher income as well as women are less likely attracted by right populists.

On the macro level we find evidence of increased likelihoods for people living in countries with higher shares in refugee population. This effect declines for countries with either extreme homogeneous or heterogeneous ethnic populations. Moreover, economic and social progress, measured by HDI, reduces the likelihood for citizens to vote for a radical right-wing party. The effect of direct democratic institutions could not be confirmed. 


This analysis is highly method driven and therefore offers several points for further improvements. First, more experimentation is needed in order to identify the right amount of populist indicators and therefore improve the quality of the cluster labels. Second, Bayesian Logistic Regression could be used to better understand model uncertainty and to replace p-values with each parameters' posterior distributions. Panel data on these issues would provide further insight into the causal mechanisms at stake. Lastly, we highly recommend to go beyond current studies and conceptualize the impact of political trust and external efficacy separately as such will probably allow more detailed insight into the extensive concept of political dissatisfaction.
