## Results

And you don‘t have confidence intervals, but so called
„uncertainty“ (or credible, or also high density) intervals,
which are quantiles of draws from the posterior distribution
(e.g. 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the posterior as 95% „CI“).

However: Typically, 90% intervals are reported, because these are
more stable than the 95% intervals, or a 89% interval (because 89 is
the closest prime number below the conventional (but arbitrary) 95;
see McElreath 2015).

95% usually require about at least 10.000 samples / draws from the posterior (Kruschke 2015).


To be precise: There is no unique
Bayesian “point estimate”. The
posterior mean minimizes expected
squared error, whereas the posterior
median minimizes expected absolute
error (i.e. the difference of estimates
from true values over samples).
