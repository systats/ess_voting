These past years populism has received great attention from the social science community [@mudde2004populist; @mudde2017populism]. It's term is both widely used and disputed [@roberts2006populism; @barr2009populists]. Several scientists have taken on the challenge of conceptualizing populism by the means of only a small number of characteristics. It has been considered as an political style, as an ideology and as an organizational form [@pauwels2014populism]. Often, the concept is broken down to political, economic, social, cultural and discursive features and are analyzed from numerous theoretical perspectives including democratic and modernization theory, social movement theory, party politics and political psychology [@postel2007populist; @goodliffe2012resurgence; @acemoglu2013political]. Within the wide range of literature there is a general agreement that populism is context-dependent and culture-bound - therefore strongly variable across countries. 

Further scholars differentiate populism based on historical periods with studies using data going back to the late 19th century [@arter2010breakthrough; @rosenthal2012steep; @levitsky2013resurgence]. Furthermore, populism cuts across ideological cleavages [@kaltwasser2014responses]: in Europe, an exclusionary right-wing variant of populism emerged in the 1980s targeting mostly immigrants and national minorities [@mudde2007populist; @ivarsflaten2008unites; @art2011inside; @berezin2013normalization]. Finding common traits which combine various populist activities across several countries remains a great challenge. The task therefore is to explain how specific circumstances and culture nurture populists politics and how these in turn impact the political sphere [@arter2010breakthrough]. Despite such difficulties, it is possible to conceptualize it by clearly identifying key features of the phenomenon to be observed, allowing a comparison of populist politics across contexts. 

The increase of right-wing extremism is of great political matter in several Western European democracies. While right-wing parties with conservative and anti-system attitudes are gaining more and more ground in the political arena, the actual democratic process is jeopardized [@coffe2007fertile]. Comparative evidence on the intentions of right-wing voters is rather insufficient, as most studies either observe solely on the individual- or on the aggregate-level (@lubbers2002extreme; @kai2008protest; @merkl2014revival). 
Nevertheless, several analyses have shown that vote intentions and therefore election outcomes for right-wing parties in Europe are mainly affected by economic circumstances such as competition and malaise [@coffe2007fertile]. 

Recent findings from France and Denmark however show that economic factors are not the prevalent explanation, rather cultural ethnic threats and their effect on far-right support [@ivarsflaten2005vulnerable]. Findings by @lubbers2007voting confirm the idea of important differences between cultural and economic threats in order to explain right-wing voting. The implementation of a more differentiated theoretical concept spread quickly, leading to more recent findings calling for the division between economic, political and sociological impact on right-wing voting. 

While analyses from the political perspective include attributes such as political landscape, party system, party-specific factors and political trust [@lubbers2002extreme; @carter2002proportional], sociological perspectives refer to the social structure and the public opinion within it and are often tested with data on education, crime rate and attitudes towards ethnic minorities [@husbands1996racism; @golder2003explaining]. @werts2013euro find evidence for the impact of increasing immigration rates as well as the use of such by right-wing parties in order to mobilize their voters [@werts2013euro]. Furthermore, they derive from the national identity approach "[...] that the EU poses same threat as mass migration, i.e. a threat to a supposed homogeneous society" [@werts2013euro, p. 188]. Turning to the EU's institutions, @ivarsflaten2005vulnerable and @van2005some show that euro-scepticism/anti-EU sentiments are important determinants for radical right-wing support. Also, @arzheimer2009christian present evidence for the relevance of euro-scepticism, although they were not able to test it's effect next to major predictors such as attitudes towards immigrants. 

Next to a variety of material resources, political participation is also triggered by cognitive resources such as political trust and efficacy. Early studies on right-wing voting rarely take such cognitive resources into account. For quite a period of time researchers did not pay enough attention to the complexity of political trust and ultimately the scientific community were left with contradictory results [@norris2005demonstrates]. More recent studies however reveal underpinning results indicating that political distrust displays a major attitude of right-wing voters and should be continuously tested in future research [@werts2013euro].
