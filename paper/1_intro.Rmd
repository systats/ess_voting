Since the 1980s many European countries have experienced a growing popularity of right-wing parties. After the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992, public support for European unification has been declining and numerous citizens are hesitant to further European integration. On the radical right, parties successfully mobilize national identity considerations by argumenting against the European Union (Hooghe and Marks, 2005; Lubbers, 2008; McLaren, 2002, De Vries and Edwards, 2009). In fact, right-wing parties such as the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), the French Front National, the Belgian Vlaams Blok, the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) and the Danish People’s Party have even successfully established themselves in political institutions, sometimes with vote shares over 10% [@swank2003globalization]. Considering such developments, it is understandable that right-wing voting has received great attention. However, have received great attention in comparative politics. Despite a series of various analyses, a disagreement persists concerning the success of right-wing parties across Europe and the motivation of citizens to vote for them [@lubbers2002extreme]. 

The appeal of right-wing parties has been growing with the discontent over the status quo: their voters feel left behind by technological change, the global economy and growing inequality. Moreover, terrorism generates anxiety and people start to hold prejudices against societies that have become more ethnically, religiously and racially diverse. Indeed, there is an increasing sense that governments and other elites ignore public concerns. Empirical findings of several European countries have shown that voters for the radical right-wing parties are dissatisfied with the established parties, the political institutions, and the democratic system in general [@kenski2006connections]. Right-wing parties advocate ethnic and cultural autonomy and successfully mobilize anti-egalitarian and anti-Western attitudes. Common characteristics of the 'old right' such as cultural relativism and racism are revitalized in order to legitimize extreme methods to protect national interests. Furthermore, their authoritarian conception of the state plays an important role. Their opinion of law-and-order is directed not only against external threats such as immigrants and asylum seekers, but also against political opponents [@heinisch2003success]. 

@kitschelt2001politische argues that the ability of right-wing parties to combine socio-culturally authoritarian perspectives with economically rightist positions has led to their success and has to be analyzed. It is specifically this 'populist' character of right-wing parties that attract right-wing voters. @heinisch2003success highlights the fact that several "[...] radical political movements that have emerged in the ‘new politics’ of post-industrial and post-cold war Europe [...] are both right-wing and populist" [@heinisch2003success, p. 92]. The term 'populist' is often rejected, as many scholars claim it being too ambiguous to be conceptually profound. Alternatively, terms like ‘radical’ and ‘extreme’ have been favored. We do not take into account such terminological specifics and decide to use all terms simultaneously for the one and only purpose: the distinction of right-wing voters and parties from the rest.

So far, the determinants of right-wing voting have mainly been studied in isolation and have not been integrated into an explanatory model of cross-national differences. In order to overcome these flaws, we analyse several theoretic hypotheses which take individual as well as aggregate characteristics of right-wing voting into account. By reducing a large propotion of existing literature to a small number of important attributes, we hope to contribute significant results to the concept of cross-country evaluation. By merging data from six different sources, we provide cross-validated information in order to guarantee more objective estimations. With a multi-level analysis of data from 27 000 respondents from 25 European countries, we are eager to answer the question why people vote for right-wing parties. We try to differentiate us from fellow researchers by providing a more method-driven and -intense paper. We combine different statistical methods like Model Based Clustering and Principal Component Analysis to deal with our high-dimensional data and deploy multi-level logistic regression to test our set of hypotheses.
