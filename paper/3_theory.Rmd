These past years, the radical right have become important players when analyzing citizens' political participation. As there are several possibilities for citizens to take part in the political process, the crucial challenge is to clarify, which activities are included in the concept. Following @verba1995voice, most researchers define it as an "activity that has the intent or effect of influencing government action - either directly by affecting the making or implementation of public policy or indirectly by influencing the selection of people who make those policies" [@brady1995beyond, p. 38]. Political participation helps governments to recognize what needs and attitudes people across the country have. These are typically acquired through several methods such as voting, campaigning or political debating [@blais2010political].

As most representative democracies are built upon electoral processes, voting in elections is the most common practice of political engagement. Elections are considered an important source of legitimization as representatives  only receive citizensâ€™ support if these are satisfied with the outcomes of the system [@easton1965systems, @buhl06]. Electoral outcomes define who operates government activities and who makes public policies. Citizens ability to vote different representatives at the next election is an ultimate instrument of power [@blais2010political].

Recent events around Europe have shown that populists use their electoral right to support right-wing parties in order to express their frustration. Early studies indicate that while most elaborated parties are known for their wide-ranging agenda on several political issues, most right-wing parties are characterized as alliances solely focusing on immigration attitudes [@husbands1988dynamics; @eatwell1998dynamics]. Further studies however indicate that broader ideological aspects are more important when explain right-wing voting [@van2000anti; @husbands2013racial] as positions of parties and voters on policy issues are mainly defined by left-right ideology [@van2000anti]. Despite researchers' effort to achieve high variance in the explanation of right-wing voting, empirical results still remain controversial, leaving enough possibilities to contribute to existing findings. 


## Individual-level Explanations

### Political Trust & External Efficacy

These past 10 years, the enhancing trend of voting for right-wing parties was often studied in connection to the Great Recession. Worsened economic conditions across most European countries as well as an extreme political crisis resulted and left their marks [@bosco2012electoral]. In response, supranational institutions pressured national governments to implement severe methods in order to face the sovereign debt crisis. Such developments quickly lead to the perception that political elites are more eager to please external demands then those of their own citizens [@armingeon2014democracy]. Indeed, recent events have shown that a large number of citizens are hesitant to encourage European integration. Several parties express euro-criticism and successfully mobilize national identity considerations against the European Union [@de2009taking; @hooghe2005calculation; @lubbers2008regarding]. These parties see the EU as a threat to the sovereignty of the nation state [@mudde2007populist]. 

Simultaneously political trust towards parties and politicians has been declining, especially in Eastern and Southern Europe [@torcal2014decline]. Citizens have started to distrust the political processes, are not convinced by the system of representative democracy and are turning more and more to populist parties [@serani2016]. While the political system is characterized as working against the common good, established parties and single elites are often accused of being incompetent, ignorant and selfish [@taggart2000populism]. Populists not only despise the political system itself, but also the economic, media and cultural elite. These are often described as one corrupt group, neglecting citizens' attitudes and wishes towards political policies [@abedi2004anti; @mudde2017populism]. Anti-elitism is therefore one of the most obvious traits of right-wing parties and nurtures the increase of right-wing voters [@meny2002constitutive].

Next to trust in parties correlating to the satisfaction with the democratic process and democracy itself, @dalton2005public investigate its impact on electoral behavior. Drawn from 'reward-punishment'-theories, they and further researchers find that voters judge parties and vote accordingly (@fiorina2002parties; @dalton2005public; @dassonneville2012electoral). They use their democratic rights to punish established parties by voting right-wing. 

The 'political disaffection'-theory highlights institutional disaffection. Next to institutional confidence, external political efficacy is the main determinant of institutional disaffection [@dassonneville2012electoral]. When citizens believe that their efforts such as voting and debating can impact politics, they are more likely to participate. External efficacy is defined through one's certainty in the responsiveness and openness of government authorities and institutions [@easton1965systems]. Citizens with low levels in political trust and external efficacy feel neglected by the political sphere, are more volatile in their party preferences as well as vote choices and are therefore interested in changing the players of the political arena by voting for an anti-system party [@dassonneville2012electoral]. We expect these citizens to be more drawn to right-wing parties which prioritize the lack of transparency and commitment towards the nation.

  **Hypothesis 1: Citizens with low levels of political trust are more likely to vote for a right-wing party.**


### Economic Deprivation 

In order to determine the success of right-wing parties, several studies have highlighted the analysis of economic conditions. Often, citizens' unemployment is used in order to analyze economic deprivation. However, since positive [@jackman1996conditions] as well as negative effects [@jesuit2004immigration] are found, the true impact of unemployment remains uncertain. Next to unemployment, further studies analyse the impact of micro variables such as education, religiosity and age. They illustrate how voters from lower social classes as well as voters with lower social strata experience more disintegration than others and therefore are more likely to vote for a right-wing party. It turns out that young, non-religious citizens with poorer education have a higher likelihood to vote for right-wing parties [@lubbers2002extreme]. 

Empirical results based on the ethnic competition theory shows that "[...] ethnic groups sharing similar economic interests are in competition for scarce resources, which induces perceived ethnic threat and intergroup antagonistic attitudes" [@coffe2007fertile, p. 185]. A great amount of ethnic groups are located in low labor sectors. Within such sectors, the unemployment rate tends to be higher and the frustration with one's social strata increases. As these citizens are more likely to come across scarcity, poverty and social exclusion, they turn to political authorities who emphasize the power of traditional norms. Citizens from lower classes are therefore less satisfied with their socio-economic position, perceive more ethnic threat and consequently turn to parties which promise policies of exclusion (@lubbers2002extreme; @coffe2007fertile). 


\vspace{0.5cm}

  **Hypothesis 2: Citizens who perceive deprivation in their socio-economic position are more likely to vote for a right-wing party.**

\vspace{0.5cm}

Similar to the competition for scarce resources, the fear of cultural resource loss is identified as determinant for anti-immigrant attitudes. The associated hostility to minorities is claimed to have a greater impact on right-wing voting than economic deprivation as populists feel directly threatened by ethnic minorities (@norris2005radical; @gijsberts2010). Indeed, empirical results show that concerns about group identity can outweigh poor economic conditions [@sniderman2004predisposing]. Latest immigrant and asylum statistics show that the number of foreigners outside the EU searching for sanctuary has risen drastically these past years and that several European countries were not prepared for such cultural changes. This quickly led to controversial integration policies such as the ban of wearing religious symbols in schools. The media in turn emphasized the negative consequences of these policies [@coffe2007fertile]. Right-wing parties then saw their opportunity to attract voters by blaming the government for failed integration and started to claim that foreigners are associated to a wide range of social issues. Even though not all voters with concerns on immigration rate vote for right-wing parties, most right-wing voters have anti-immigration attitudes and want more restrictive policies [@sniderman2004predisposing; @coffe2007fertile]. In conclusion, we expect voters with cultural anti-immigrant attitudes to be more likely to vote for a radical right-wing party. We draw this back to two attributes: 1. these voters experience more cultural ethnic threat, and 2. their wishes towards immigration and asylum policies are ignored by other parties.

  **Hypothesis 3: Citizens who perceive cultural ethnic threats, hold a more hostile attitudes towards minorties and are therefore more likely to vote for a right-wing party.**

Next to our main hypotheses we follow previous research by integrating voters' political interest, income, gender, religiosity and self-assessment on the political left-right scale. 


## Contextual Factors

Little research has been done on the impact of both individual- and country-level characteristics on the success of right-wing parties. 
@jackman1996conditions conducted a first large scale quantitative comparative analysis right-wing parties' electoral success. Their main findings were that high unemployment rates and a multi-party system in combination with a proportional electoral system lead to electoral success for right-wing parties. @knigge1998ecological confirms these relationships and also stresses the importance of including both micro- and macro-level determinants.

In existing comparative electoral participation research, most studies on participation include politico-institutional determinants [@haskell2018direct]. Our first approach to explain extreme right-wing voting from a macro-perspective is the observation of such political factors as empirical evidence on their impact is rather scarce.

In the age of populism, polls illustrate that a great amount of citizens are not satisfied with the concepts of checks and balances as well as federalism as these tend to limit parties in their action. Consequently, governments are too distant from and unresponsive to the concerns of the people and therefore undemocratic. In order to overcome the distance between voters and the political establishment, @barber2003strong suggests to implement more community-based actions. Moreover, the use of national referendum and representative citizen assemblies are claimed to be effective innovations against perceptions of isolation [@dahl1989democracy; @phillips1996arrogant; @fishkin1997voice]. 

Indeed, empirical results show that direct democratic institutions are becoming more popular, especially when debating about the most important public issues. Populists argue that representative institutions ignore the will of ordinary citizens and suggest more direct-based participation such as initiatives and referenda [@haskell2018direct]. With the implementation of more direct democratic institutions, the government, parliament and parties hand over segments of competence to voters who recognize that they are "[...]in a position to decide authoritatively on important issues, independently and without recourse to members of parliament" [@buhlmann2006individual, p.20]. Drawn from this previous research, we come to the conclusion that citizens from countries with greater amounts of direct democratic institutions should perceive less political distance than others and should therefore be less likely to vote for a right-wing party.

  **Hypothesis 4: In countries with with greater amounts of direct democratic institutions, citizens are less likely to vote for a right-wing party.**

As previously discussed, perceived economic and cultural ethnic threats play an important role when analyzing right-wing voting. One may not only expect conflict to be more severe in regions with high levels of unemployment, but also in regions where the level of immigration is high. For example on the labor market, migrants and refugees are perceived as unfair competition. Often, populists stress rising refugee rates and are frustrated with the sole presence of such foreigners. Populists feel overwhelmed by the masses of immigration and therefore judge their own social opportunities to be poor. Since extreme right parties take advantage of these feelings of competition, the presence of immigrants and refugees may facilitate their electoral growth. @lubbers2002extreme merge surveys from 16 West European countries and conclude that the number of non-Western residents has a substantial impact on the likelihood of an extreme right vote. @golder2003explaining confirms this claim and finds an additional positive interaction between unemployment and immigration rates. Indeed, the size of the 'out-group population' is often used to predict right-wing success, as it is claimed to encourage prejudices, negative attitudes towards foreigners and lastly discrimination. An increase in the relative size of the migrant and refugee population creates competitive perceptions which, again, leads to success of right-wing parties [@semyonov2008foreigners]. Consequently, we argue that immigrantsâ€™ and refugees' presence translates into electoral successes for extreme right.

  **Hypothesis 5: In countries with higher shares of migrant and refugee populations, citizens are more likely to vote for a radical right-wing party.**

Lastly, we take the effect of modernization into account as it is often stressed when analyzing contextual variables of right-wing voting. Several studies report the consequences of the industrialization in Europe and highlight 'losers' of modernization and globalization. Since the 1980s, Western Europe experienced severe economic developments captured by new information technologies, maturation of the welfare state and growth of the service sector. Society was obviously transforming fundamentally 
and soon the erosion of industrial mass production had and still has a great impact on the political sphere. Ordinary workers have been hit hardest as their market position has been weakened. These voters have difficulties in finding their place in the post-modernistic and capitalistic society of today [@betz1993new;  @oesch2008explaining]. 

During all these economic processes within the European Union, work immigration and integration expanded and right-wing parties saw their advantage in advocating against international competition and trade as well as further work immigration [@oesch2008explaining]. Being the main victims of economic dislocations, workers may express their resentment towards societal changes by turning to the political right. They perceive themselves as the losers of modernization, are frustrated and will be more likely to vote for a right-wing party as these claim to represent them. Especially under conditions of massive societal change such as mass immigration, these 'losers' will vote for right-wing parties [@rydgren2005extreme; @oesch2008explaining].

A small amount of studies however challenge these assumptions by indicating that not only the 'losers' of modernization but also 'winners' support right-wing parties. Thereby they stress the fact that right-wing support can not be traced back to economic dislocation. Dissatisfaction appears when voters are frustrated about several aspects of the economic and social system as they are not receiving the services they desire. Well-functioning modern systems nurture positive attitudes towards the political sphere and encourage political interest [@flecker2007potentials; @zaslove2009populist]. Next to education and income, these are claimed to be common attributes of non right-wing voters. We expect these attributes, which are frequently used to measure development in modern democracies, to be more appropriate for the analysis of right-wing success than the classical modernization 'losers'- hypothesis. Modern democracies are characterized by industrialization, urbanization, rising levels of formal education and social services and, therefore, relatively secure and high levels of standard of living. As voters who are frustrated with such institutions are more likely to vote for right-wing parties, we expect countries with higher levels in economic and social development to experience less right-wing success. 

\vspace{0.5cm}

  **Hypothesis 6: In countries with higher levels of economic and social development, citizens are more likely to vote for a radical right-wing party.**
